## Overview

This repository contains code for analyzing **Hanbury-Brown and Twiss (HBT) correlations** in peripheral PbPb collisions using the ROOT framework. The goal of this project is to characterize the spatial and temporal dimensions of particle-emitting regions in these collisions, providing insight into the properties of **Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)**.

This analysis uses CMS Open Data for collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair. The repository also includes various tools for data selection, event centrality categorization, and HBT correlation calculations.

## Key Features

- **Centrality Selection**: Filters collision data based on event centrality using the `centrality_selector()` function.
- **HBT Analysis**: Performs HBT correlation analysis with options for different source parameters and event types.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates plots for correlation functions, source radii, and other relevant properties.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **ROOT**: Ensure that ROOT is installed and configured with multithreading support.
- **C++**: The analysis scripts are written in C++.
- **Python**: Some helper scripts may require Python (for visualization or data handling).
